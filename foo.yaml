  description: "Reservations for South Campground are available up to 14 days before\
    \ your arrival and may extend up to two days beyond this 14-day booking window.\
    \ \_ \n For visitors to Zion National Park, South Campground is an ideal place\
    \ to stay.  Located near the park's south entrance, the campground is just a short\
    \ walk from the main visitor center, the Zion Canyon Shuttle System and the adjacent\
    \ town of Springdale. The canyon and most of the park's trails are only accessible\
    \ by shuttle bus from approximately the end of February until the end of November\
    \ each year.   Season Dates:  South Campground is open from early March to the\
    \ end of October. Reservations are available up to 14 days before your arrival.\
    \ For example, if you want to make a reservation for March 14 to 16, you may book\
    \ this reservation beginning on March 1. Reservations that extend beyond the 14\
    \ day booking window cannot be altered. \n For reservations more than 14 days\
    \ ahead of arrival, please check   Watchman Campground    which offers reservations\
    \ six months in advance of arrival. \nZion is known for its dynamic geologic history.\
    \ The South Campground and Amphitheater were built by the Civilian Conservation\
    \ Corp in the early 1930s. The project was completed and opened to the public\
    \ in the spring of 1935. The Virgin River, a narrow but powerful river that has\
    \ carved out the canyon over time, runs adjacent to the site. Cottonwood trees\
    \ surrounding the campsite turn golden in the fall. Although the campground is\
    \ moderately forested, most of the campsites are in partial to full sun but visitors\
    \ can cool off in the cold river when temperatures peak during summer.     \n\
    \    \nBe Advised: The months of April and May bring an unusual infestation of\
    \ Tent Caterpillars, which fall from trees onto tents, tables, and unsuspecting\
    \ campers and can make it quite uncomfortable to sit outside. The months of July\
    \ and August in particular bring a higher concentration of ants in the campsites,\
    \ which seem to come out especially after the monsoons, but are present all summer\
    \ long. August and September bring yellowjackets. Insecticidal treatment by visitors\
    \ is not permitted.The town of Springdale has shopping, art galleries, shower\
    \ facilities, restaurants. equipment rental businesses, gas stations, markets,\
    \ bike rentals, library and health clinic.Hikers can access three trails directly\
    \ from the facility: the Watchman Trail, a moderate trail that ascends the peak\
    \ behind the campground; the Archeology Trail, which offers a light hike to an\
    \ archeological site; and the Pa'rus Trail, a paved walking and biking trail that\
    \ runs alongside the river, and the only trail in the park that allows dogs. \n\
    \nThe Zion visitor center and the park shuttles are a short walk from the campground.\
    \ Many popular rock climbing routes are within a short shuttle bus ride into the\
    \ main canyon.\n\n\n\n Use of OHVs and ATVs is prohibited in Zion National Park.Flush\
    \ toilets, drinking water, picnic tables, firepits and a dump station are provided\
    \ at this facility. Four group sites are available that can accommodate RVs and\
    \ tents. There are no hook-ups in this campground. Generators can be used during\
    \ specific hours."
